ðŸš€â”ƒInstallation & Usage
Since this is a browser extension that is not on the official web stores, you need to load it manually. Follow the instructions for your browser below.

> Download From here https://github.com/Wplace-AutoBot/WPlace-AutoBOT/releases/tag/Extension

>Extract: Unzip the downloaded file (Extension.zip) to a permanent folder you won't delete.

>Open Extensions Page: Open your browser and go to the extensions page. You can usually do this by typing chrome://extensions (for Chrome) or edge://extensions (for Edge) in your address bar.

>Enable Developer Mode: Find and turn on the Developer mode toggle, usually located in the top-right corner of the page.

>Load the Extension: Click on the Load unpacked button that appears.

>Select Folder: In the file dialog, navigate to the folder where you extracted the files and select the main folder (the one containing manifest.json).

>Done! The WPlace AutoBOT extension should now appear in your extensions list and be active. Visit wplace.live and the bot menu will appear.

For Firefox:
> Download https://github.com/Wplace-AutoBot/WPlace-AutoBOT/releases/tag/Extension

>Open Debugging Page: Open Firefox and type about:debugging into the address bar and press Enter.

>Select "This Firefox": In the left-hand menu, click on This Firefox.

>Load Temporary Add-on: Click on the Load Temporary Add-on... button.

>Select File: Navigate into the folder you extracted and select the manifest.json file.

>Done! The extension is now loaded for your current browser session. Visit wplace.live to use it. Note: For Firefox, you may need to repeat this process every time you restart the browser.

For Mobile (Android Only):
You can use the extension on Android using a browser that supports Chrome extensions, such as Kiwi Browser.
